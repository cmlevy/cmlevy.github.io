I am a senior at Colgate University studying physics and mathematics. I love abstraction and so am drawn to a career researching theoretical physics. I have been fortunate thus far in my academic career to have experience doing physics research, including on astroparticle dark matter phenomenology at [Colgate](https://www.colgate.edu/news/stories/exploring-mysteries-dark-matter), galaxy detection with machine learning at [Fermilab](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1834181), and learning about theories of quantum gravity at [MIT](https://oge.mit.edu/msrp/profiles/caleb-levy/).

Academic Goals
------
I love theoretical physics and would like to spend my academic career studying at the frontiers of this broad field. In the short-term, I envision myself pursuing a PhD in theoretical physics. My interests right now are in developments toward a complete theory of quantum gravity, and in this vein am interested in black hole information and string theory. However, I would also be very interested in exploring other theoretical fields in graduate school, including quantum information, algebraic quantum field theory, and lattice QCD. All in all, I'm simply interested in understanding the world around me from a theoretical lens and would be happy to pursue this objective from many perspectives.


Outside of Academics
======
Of course, I don't spend ALL my time doing physics. I would go crazy...

Music
------
One of my major non-academic interests is in music. I started to become very passionate about music during my freshman year. This is when I began learning piano, classical at first. It's also when I was first exposed to jazz beyond elevator music through my first year seminar course, "A History of Jazz".

Sports
------
I am not incredibly athletic, but I do enjoy playing and watching a variety of sports. My favorite to play include tennis, soccer, frisbee, and football. I love going to live sporting events, particularly basketball, hockey, and soccer. I am also a sucker for grand slam tournaments and love watching Nadal play!

DEI Initiatives
------
I am a big supporter of DEI initiatives in general, and specifically those gauged towards improving representation of minority groups in physics. To this end, I am apart of the [APS-IDEA initiative](https://www.aps.org/programs/innovation/fund/idea.cfm) chapter run by Colgate's Physics and Astronomy Department. Through this program, I have helped in brainstorming and executing ideas aimed at improving retention among minorities, including serving as a physics mentor to underclassmen and creating a library loaning system for Physics textbooks.
