I am a senior at Colgate University studying physics and mathematics. I love abstraction and so am drawn to a career researching theoretical physics. I have been fortunate thus far in my academic career to have experience doing physics research, including on [astroparticle dark matter phenomenology at Colgate](https://www.colgate.edu/news/stories/exploring-mysteries-dark-matter), [galaxy detection with machine learning at Fermilab](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1834181), and [learning about theories of quantum gravity]().

Outside of Physics
======
Of course, I don't spend ALL my time doing physics. I would go crazy...
Music
------
One of my major non-academic interests is in music. I started to become very passionate about music during my freshman year. This is when I began learning piano, classical at first. It's also when I was first exposed to jazz beyond elevator music through my first year seminar course, "A History of Jazz".


Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
