I am a senior at Colgate University studying physics and mathematics. I love abstraction and so am drawn to a career researching theoretical physics. I have been fortunate thus far in my academic career to have experience doing physics research, including on astroparticle dark matter phenomenology at [Colgate](https://www.colgate.edu/news/stories/exploring-mysteries-dark-matter), galaxy detection with machine learning at [Fermilab](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1834181), and learning about theories of quantum gravity at [MIT](https://oge.mit.edu/msrp/profiles/caleb-levy/).



Outside of Physics
======
Of course, I don't spend ALL my time doing physics. I would go crazy...

Music
------
One of my major non-academic interests is in music. I started to become very passionate about music during my freshman year. This is when I began learning piano, classical at first. It's also when I was first exposed to jazz beyond elevator music through my first year seminar course, "A History of Jazz".

Sports
------
I am not incredibly athletic, but I do enjoy playing and watching a variety of sports. My favorite to play include tennis, soccer, frisbee, and football. I love going to live sporting events, particularly basketball, hockey, and soccer. I am also a sucker for grand slam tournaments and love watching Nadal play!
