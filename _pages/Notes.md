[Notes on free field theory and black hole evaporation](https://cmlevy.github.io/files/BlackHoleNotes.pdf)
---
These are notes on free field theory and the black hole information problem that were compiled at the end of my summer at the Center for Theoretical Physics at MIT. They are designed to provide a succinct but detailed introduction to this issue that should be accessible to anyone with some background in quantum mechanics and general relativity.
