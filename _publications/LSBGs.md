collection: publications
permalink: /publication/LSBGs
excerpt: 'Low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs), galaxies that are fainter than the dark
night sky, are famously difficult to detect. Nonetheless, studies of these galaxies are
essential to improve our understanding of the formation and evolution of low-mass
galaxies. In this work, we train a deep learning model using the Mask R-CNN
framework on a set of simulated LSBGs inserted into images from the Dark Energy
Survey (DES) Data Release 2 (DR2). This deep learning model is combined
with several conventional image pre-processing steps to develop a pipeline for the
detection of LSBGs. We apply this pipeline to the full DES DR2 coadd image
dataset, and preliminary results show the detection of 22 large, high-quality LSBG
candidates that went undetected by conventional algorithms. Furthermore, we find
that the performance of our algorithm is greatly improved by including examples
of false positives as an additional class during training.'
