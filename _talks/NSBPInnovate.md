[Multicomponent multiscatter capture of dark matter](https://nsbp.org/blogpost/1882533/385354/Innovate-Seminar-Series-December-1-2021)
=====

I was invited to give this talk as part of the Innovate Seminar Series by the National Society of Black Physicists, hosted by the Kavli Institute of Theoretical Physics. In this talk, I discuss my work with Professor Cosmin Ilie on extending the formalism for dark matter capture to objects with several nuclear species, as oppossed to one type of nucleus as commonly assumed.
